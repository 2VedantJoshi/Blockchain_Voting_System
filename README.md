Blockchain-Based Voting System
Project Description
The Blockchain-Based Voting System is a web application designed to provide a secure, transparent, and tamper-proof voting platform. It leverages blockchain technology to ensure the integrity and immutability of voting records, enhancing trust and reliability in the voting process.

Features
User Roles and Authentication:

Voter Login: Registered users can log in to cast their vote.
Candidate Login and Registration: Candidates can log in to register themselves for elections.
Secure authentication ensures that only authorized users access the system.
Voting Process:

Voters can cast their votes securely.
The system prevents duplicate voting by tracking if a user has already voted.
Blockchain Integration:

Votes are recorded as transactions on the blockchain.
Each vote creates an immutable block, ensuring that voting records cannot be altered.
Candidate Management:

Candidates can be registered with details stored in the database.
Vote counts for each candidate are maintained and displayed.
Transparency:

A blockchain explorer is included to view the complete blockchain, ensuring transparency.
Admin Features:

Admins can manage candidates and oversee the voting process.
Technologies Used
Backend:

Django Framework: For handling server-side logic and database integration.
SQLite: Default database for development (can be replaced with PostgreSQL/MySQL for production).
Blockchain:

A simple blockchain implementation to record votes as immutable blocks.
Frontend:

HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for a user-friendly interface.
Authentication:

Django’s built-in authentication system for secure login/logout.
Version Control:

Git and GitHub for version control and project collaboration.
How It Works
User Registration and Login:

Users sign up and log in to the platform.
Candidates log in to register themselves for elections.
Voting Process:

Voters browse the list of candidates and cast their vote.
The vote is recorded in the database and added as a transaction to the blockchain.
Blockchain Functionality:

Each vote generates a transaction.
Transactions are grouped into blocks.
Blocks are added to the blockchain, ensuring data integrity.
Result Viewing:

Users can view the current votes for each candidate.
Blockchain explorer provides a transparent view of the voting records.
